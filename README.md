## Design patterns categorized

* ### Creational Design Patterns:** Design patterns that deal with object creation.
  * **[Simple Factory / Factory Pattern](#simple-factory):** The Simple Factory provides a class that instantiates objects. This pattern is used to increase scalability by keeping the instantiation logic in one place. 
  * **Factory Method / Virtual Constructor:** A factory class instantiates objects based on classes with a common parent class or interface using polymorphism. This way we guarantee type dependencies and decrease invalid type errors. 
  * **Abstract Factory / Kit Pattern:**

#### Creational design patterns
Defers object creation to subclasses.
#### Structural design patterns
Describes ways to assemble objects.
#### Behavioral design patterns
Describes how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can do alone.

## Simple Factory
###### [< Back to pattern overview](#design-patterns-categorized)
 
![alt text]( https://github.com/StephenGoedhart/DesignPatternsSimplified/blob/master/Src/images/SimpleFactoryDesignPattern.png "Simple Factory Design Pattern Diagram")

A class that instantiates objects of certain classes. Used to increase loose coupling and to increase scalability by keeping the instantiation logic in one place. 

###### C# Code example:
```C#
    public class Dog
    {
        public Dog()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Created Dog");
        }
    }
    
    public class Cat
    {
        public Cat()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Created Cat");
        }
    }
    
    public class AnimalFactory
    {
        public Dog createDog()
        {
            return new Dog();
        }
        public Cat createCat()
        {
            return new Cat();
        }
    }

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    AnimalFactory animalFactory = new AnimalFactory();
    Dog dog = animalFactory.createDog();
    Cat cat = animalFactory.createCat();
}

//Output: 
//Created Dog
//Created Cat
```

## Factory Method- / Virtual Constructor Pattern

![alt text]( https://github.com/StephenGoedhart/DesignPatternsSimplified/blob/master/Src/images/factoryMethodDesignPatternDiagram.png "Factory Method Design Pattern Diagram")

A factory class instantiates objects based on classes with a common parent class or interface using polymorphism. This way we guarantee type and decrease invalid type errors.

###### C# Code example:
```C#
public interface IShape
    {
        void printShape();
    }

    public class Circle : IShape
    {
        public void printShape()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a circle");
        }
    }
    public class Rectangle : IShape
    {
        public void printShape()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a rectangle");
        }
    }
    public class Triangle : IShape
    {
        public void printShape()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("This is a triangle");
        }
    }

    public class ShapeFactory
    {
        public enum Type { circle, rectangle, triangle }
        public IShape Create(Type type)
        {
            switch (type)
            {
                case Type.circle:
                    return new Circle();
                    break;
                case Type.rectangle:
                    return new Rectangle();
                    break;
                case Type.triangle:
                    return new Triangle();
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new Exception("Invalid ShapeFactory type supplied...");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("//------------------- Factory Design Pattern ----------------------//");
            ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();
            IShape circle = shapeFactory.Create(ShapeFactory.Type.circle);
            IShape rectangle = shapeFactory.Create(ShapeFactory.Type.rectangle);
            IShape triangle = shapeFactory.Create(ShapeFactory.Type.triangle);

            circle.printShape();
            rectangle.printShape();
            triangle.printShape();
	}
//Output: 
//This is a circle 
//This is a rectangle
//This is a triangle
```

## Command Pattern

![alt text]( https://github.com/StephenGoedhart/DesignPatternsSimplified/blob/master/Src/images/commandDesignPatternDiagram.png "Command Design Pattern Diagram")

By separating method invocation from method declaration using the implementation of the command design pattern we reach a new level of decoupling and possibilities.
* Call multiple receiver methods within the command. 
* Call commands within commands. 
* Extent behavior by adding / altering commands without worrying about the actual implementation. 
* Alter implementation in the receiver class without worrying it’s dependencies.  

###### C# Code example:
```C#
    //By using an interface we guarantee type related functionality.
    public interface ICommand
    {
        void Execute();
        void Undo();
    }

    //Use a receiver interface to enable the use of polymorphism later on.
    public interface IVehicle
    {
        void turnOn();
        void turnOff();
        void GearUp();
        void GearDown();
    }

    //Define a receiver class that implements the receiver interface
    public class Car : IVehicle 
    {
        private int gear = 0;

        public void turnOn()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Car started");
        }

        public void turnOff()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Car stopped");
        }

        public void GearUp()
        {
            gear++;
            Console.WriteLine("Car switched gear to: " + gear);
        }

        public void GearDown()
        {
            gear--;
            Console.WriteLine("Car switched gear to: " + gear);
        }

    }

    //Define another receiver class that implements the receiver interface
    public class Plane : IVehicle
    {
        public void turnOn()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Plane engine spooling up");
        }

        }
        public void GearDown()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Landing Gear Down");
        }         
    }

    //A command can be as specific as you'd like. This command only adheres to Car objects. 
    public class CarGearUp : ICommand
    {
        private IVehicle car;
        public CarGearUp(IVehicle newCar)
        {
            car = newCar;
        }

        public void Execute()
        {
            car.GearUp();
        }

        public void Undo()
        {
            car.GearDown();
        }
    }

    //A command can be as specific as you'd like. This command only adheres to Plane objects. 
    public class PlaneGearUp : ICommand
    {
        private IVehicle plane;
        public PlaneGearUp(IVehicle newPlane)
        {

    //A command can be as specific as you'd like. This command adheres to all IVehicle types. 
    public class TurnAllVehiclesOff : ICommand

            scheduler.Add(carGearUp);
            scheduler.Add(planeGearUp);
            scheduler.Add(turnAllOff);

            //We don't need to know anything about the objects or the commands to execute them.
            //This level of encapsulation is what the command design pattern is all about.
