## 23 Design patterns categorized

* #### Creational Design Patterns
Design patterns that deal with object creation.
  * #### Factory Method: 
The Factory design pattern instantiates objects based on classes with a common parent class or interface. Instantiating such objects in a factory class, we guarantee type dependencies and decrease invalid type errors.
* #### Abstract Factory: 


* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b


Design patterns that deal with object creation.

* Abstract Factory
* Builder
* Prototype
* Singleton
2. Structural Design Patterns
* Adapter	
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Proxy
3. Behavioral Design Patterns
* Interpreter
* Template method
* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Memento
* Flyweight
* Observer
* State
* Strategy
* Visitor

#### Creational design patterns
Defers object creation to subclasses.
#### Structural design patterns
Describes ways to assemble objects.
#### Behavioral design patterns
Describes how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can do alone.
## Use cases for:
#### Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Prototype
When you want to use polymorphism to instantiate objects of classes with a common parent class. Not using the design pattern may lead to faulty instantiation and code assuming inheritance that isn’t available. 

#### Chain of Responsibility, Command
By separating method invocation (command) from method declaration (receiver) using the implementation of the command design pattern we reach a new level of decoupling and possibilities.
* Call multiple receiver methods within the command. 
* Call commands within commands. 
* Extent behavior by adding / altering commands without worrying about the actual implementation. 
* Alter implementation in the receiver class without worrying it’s dependencies.  


## Command Pattern

![alt text]( https://github.com/StephenGoedhart/DesignPatternsSimplified/blob/master/Src/images/commandDesignPatternDiagram.png "Command Design Pattern Diagram")

By separating method invocation from method declaration using the implementation of the command design pattern we reach a new level of decoupling and possibilities.
* Call multiple receiver methods within the command. 
* Call commands within commands. 
* Extent behavior by adding / altering commands without worrying about the actual implementation. 
* Alter implementation in the receiver class without worrying it’s dependencies.  

###### C# Code example:
```C#
    //By using an interface we guarantee type related functionality.
    public interface ICommand
    {
        void Execute();
        void Undo();
    }

    //Use a receiver interface to enable the use of polymorphism later on.
    public interface IVehicle
    {
        void turnOn();
        void turnOff();
        void GearUp();
        void GearDown();
    }

    //Define a receiver class that implements the receiver interface
    public class Car : IVehicle 
    {
        private int gear = 0;

        public void turnOn()
        {

        }

        public void turnOff()

            //We don't need to know anything about the objects or the commands to execute them.
            //This level of encapsulation is what the command design pattern is all about.
